- Added user tracking to all data modification operations
- Implemented soft delete patterns with recycle bin functionality

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables Created:

1. **stock_reservations**
   - Tracks reserved stock for pending orders
   - Includes expiration handling
   - Foreign key relationships to orders, products, and stores

2. **stock_movements**
   - Detailed history of all stock movements
   - Categorized by reason (SALE, RETURN, DAMAGE, etc.)
   - User tracking and timestamps

3. **audit_logs**
   - Comprehensive audit trail of all system activities
   - Entity tracking with before/after values
   - User and IP address tracking

### New Enums:

1. **StockAdjustmentReason**
   - SALE, RETURN, DAMAGE, THEFT, CORRECTION, RECEIPT, TRANSFER, RESERVATION, RESERVATION_RELEASE

2. **OrderStatusTransition**
   - PENDING_TO_PROCESSING, PENDING_TO_CANCELLED, PROCESSING_TO_COMPLETED, PROCESSING_TO_CANCELLED, COMPLETED_TO_REFUNDED

## API Endpoints Added

### Audit Endpoints (`/audit/*`):
- `GET /audit/logs` - Retrieve audit logs with filtering
- `GET /audit/logs/:entityType/:entityId` - Get logs for specific entity
- `GET /audit/users` - Get users who have made changes
- `GET /audit/entity-types` - Get available entity types
- `GET /audit/actions` - Get available actions
- `POST /audit/export` - Export audit logs in CSV/JSON format

### Inventory Endpoints (`/inventory/stock/*`):
- `GET /inventory/stock/adjustments` - Get stock movement history
- `POST /inventory/stock/adjustments` - Create stock adjustment
- `GET /inventory/stock/reservations` - Get stock reservations
- `POST /inventory/stock/reservations/cleanup` - Cleanup expired reservations
- `POST /inventory/stock/transfer` - Transfer stock between products/variants

## Frontend Components Created

### Audit Components:
- **ActivityDashboard** - Main audit dashboard with overview
- **UserActivityLog** - User-specific activity tracking
- **EntityHistory** - Entity-specific change history
- **ExportDialog** - Audit log export functionality

### Inventory Components:
- **StockAdjustmentDialog** - Stock adjustment interface
- **StockTransferDialog** - Stock transfer functionality
- **LowStockAlerts** - Low stock alert monitoring
- **StockValidation** - Real-time stock validation

### Order Components:
- **PaymentVerification** - Payment verification interface
- **StatusWorkflow** - Order status transition workflow
- **CancellationDialog** - Order cancellation with refund processing

## Services Created

### Backend Services:
- **StockService** - Stock management and reservation handling
- **AuditService** - Audit logging and retrieval
- **OrderService** - Enhanced order processing with safety checks
- **ValidationService** - Data validation and constraint checking
- **CleanupService** - Periodic cleanup of expired reservations

## Testing and Validation

All new features have been tested and validated:
- ✅ Database migrations applied successfully
- ✅ API endpoints registered and secured
- ✅ Frontend components integrated
- ✅ Services functioning correctly
- ✅ Authentication properly enforced

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements:
1. **Real-time Stock Updates**: WebSocket-based real-time stock updates
2. **Advanced Reporting**: More sophisticated audit reporting capabilities
3. **Batch Operations**: Bulk stock adjustment and transfer operations
4. **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive integration testing suite
5. **Performance Optimization**: Query optimization for large datasets

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Stock Adjustment:
```javascript
// Frontend API call
const adjustment = {
  productId: 'product-123',
  quantityChange: -5,
  reason: 'SALE',
  notes: 'POS sale'
};

await inventoryApi.createStockAdjustment(adjustment);
```

### Retrieving Audit Logs:
```javascript
// Frontend API call
const logs = await auditApi.getLogs({
  entityType: 'product',
  action: 'UPDATE',
  limit: 50
});
```

### Stock Reservation Process:
```javascript
// Backend service call
await StockService.reserveStock(
  orderId,
  items,
  storeId,
  userId
);
```

## Security Considerations

- All new endpoints are properly secured with authentication
- Data validation prevents injection attacks
- Audit logs include user and IP address tracking
- Soft delete prevents accidental data loss

## Performance Considerations

- Database indexes added for frequently queried fields
- Pagination implemented for large result sets
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Efficient query patterns to minimize database load

This implementation provides a robust foundation for stock management and audit trails that can scale with the growing needs of the retail management system.
