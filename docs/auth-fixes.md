# Authentication System Fixes

## Problem Identified

The backend was experiencing 500 Internal Server Errors when accessing protected routes like `/products` and `/orders`. The root cause was that these routes were trying to access `request.user` without first authenticating the request.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Products Routes (`back/src/products/index.ts`)

**Problem**: All product routes were trying to access `request.user` but weren't calling the authentication middleware.

**Solution**: 
- Added imports for `authenticateStoreUser` and `TokenService`
- Created a `TokenService` instance
- Added a helper function `getUserFromRequest` to safely extract user data
- Updated all route handlers to call authentication middleware first:
  ```javascript
  // Authenticate first
  await authenticateStoreUser(request, reply, tokenService);
  if (reply.sent) return; // If authentication failed, response already sent
  ```

**Routes Fixed**:
- GET `/products` - Get all products
- POST `/products` - Create new product
- GET `/products/:id` - Get single product
- PUT `/products/:id` - Update product
- DELETE `/products/:id` - Delete product

### 2. Orders Routes (`back/src/orders/index.ts`)

**Problem**: All order routes were trying to access `request.user` but weren't calling the authentication middleware.

**Solution**: 
- Added imports for `authenticateStoreUser` and `TokenService`
- Created a `TokenService` instance
- Added a helper function `getUserFromRequest` to safely extract user data
- Updated all route handlers to call authentication middleware first:
  ```javascript
  // Authenticate first
  await authenticateStoreUser(request, reply, tokenService);
  if (reply.sent) return; // If authentication failed, response already sent
  ```

**Routes Fixed**:
- GET `/orders` - Get all orders
- GET `/orders/:id` - Get single order
- POST `/orders` - Create new order
- PUT `/orders/:id` - Update order

## Verification

### Before Fix:
- Requests to `/products` and `/orders` returned 500 errors
- Error: `request.user is undefined`
- No authentication middleware was being called

### After Fix:
- Requests to `/products` and `/orders` correctly return 401 Unauthorized when no valid token is provided
- Requests with valid tokens work properly
- All protected routes now properly authenticate before accessing user data

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes:
```bash
node back/test-auth-fix.js
```

Expected behavior:
- Endpoints should return 401 (Unauthorized) instead of 500 (Internal Server Error)
- Proper authentication flow should work when valid tokens are provided

## Impact

This fix resolves the critical authentication issues that were preventing the frontend from accessing product and order data. The system now properly enforces authentication on all protected routes while providing clear error responses.

## Related Components

The following routes already had proper authentication and were not affected:
- Store routes (`/store`)
- Inventory routes (`/inventory`)
- Analytics routes (`/analytics`)
- POS routes (`/pos`)
- Payments routes (`/payments`)
